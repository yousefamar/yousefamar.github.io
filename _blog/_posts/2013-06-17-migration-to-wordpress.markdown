After taking a closer look at what WordPress has to offer, I don't know what I was thinking using Tumblr as a blogging platform. Not that I left Tumblr because it's bad, it's just not at all suited for my kind of format. WordPress is to Tumblr what Tumblr is to Twitter if that makes any sense. I didn't leave Tumblr because Yahoo bought it, just to be clear.

So now I have much better control over what goes on here especially since all of this is running on my own server. This will probably mean I'll post more stuff too!
